# sg-radio-bot

This is a discord bot that relays radio feed from radio stations in Singapore into any Discord voice channel.
It currently isn't designed to work outside of my use case right now, but I will modify the code in the future so that other people can use it in a more practical manner.

As such, I will not be providing any intructions on how to set this bot up as of yet. But, if you do have some experience in coding, it should be simple enough for you.
